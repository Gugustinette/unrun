# Introduction

**Unrun** is a tool that allows you to dynamically load and execute JavaScript or TypeScript code at runtime.

As it is powered by [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/), it supports a wide range of module formats and syntax, including ESM and CJS (with interop), TypeScript, and JSX.

## Credits

Unrun was highly inspired by existing tools like :

- [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti)
- [bundle-require](https://github.com/egoist/bundle-require)
- [tsx](https://tsx.is/)

In fact, unrun is tested against most of the test cases from `jiti` and `bundle-require` to ensure high compatibility.
