# Presets

The `preset` option is a way to setup unrun so it tries to mimic the behavior of
other similar tools.

- [`bundle-require`](https://github.com/egoist/bundle-require/) : always return the module as-is, without trying to access the `default` export.
- [`jiti`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti/) : add plugins to support few edge cases and has specific returning behavior.
